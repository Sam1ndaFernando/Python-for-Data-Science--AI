# he code you've provided is a good start for handling the tasks you've outlined. I'll guide you through each of the steps and ensure everything works as expected.

# Hereâ€™s how we can extend it to meet your requirements:

# Read the JSON file: This is already handled by read_json(file_path).
# Display all students: The function display_students(data) works for this.
# Display students who scored above 75: The function display_above_75(data) achieves this.
# Add a new student to the file: add_student(data, new_student) is there to append a new student to the list.
# Save the file back to JSON: save_json(file_path, data) does this by saving the modified data.


# import json

# def read_json(file_path):
#     with open(file_path, 'r') as file:

# def display_above_75(data):

#     for student in data:
#         if student['score'] > 75:
#             print(student)

# def add_student(data, new_student):
#     data.append(new_student)

# Task: Create a Python Program to Manage Employee Records
# The goal is to create a Python program that manages company employee records stored in a CSV file. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Read the Input File

# Use the csv.reader to read employee.csv, which contains the following fields:
# employeeId
# name
# department
# salary
# Display all employee records on the console.
# Filter the Records

# Identify employees whose salary is above 57,000.
# Write the Filtered Records to a New File

# Use csv.DictWriter to write the filtered records to a new file named high_salary_employee.csv.
# The new file should retain the same fields as the input file:
# employeeId
# name
# department
# salary
